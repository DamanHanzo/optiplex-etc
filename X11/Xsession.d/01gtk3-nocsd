# gtk3-nocsd global configuration
#
# This file configures the global behavior of gtk3-nocsd. These
# settings may be overridden by individual users by setting the same
# variables to different values in their ~/.xsessionrc.

#
# Whether to disable CSD on non-GNOME desktops
#    0: disable CSD
#    1: enable CSD
#
# If this setting is left unset, it will default to 0 (CSD disabled)
# unless GTK3_NOCSD_IGNORE is set to 1, in which case it will remain
# unset. (With gtk defaulting to showing CSDs.)
#
#export GTK_CSD=0

#
# Whether to not preload libgtk3-nocsd.so.0 even if GTK_CSD=0
#
# If this setting is set to 1, LD_PRELOAD and GTK_CSD will not be
# touched upon session startup.
#
#export GTK3_NOCSD_IGNORE=0
